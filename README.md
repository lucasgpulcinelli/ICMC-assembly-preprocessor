# ICMC Assembly Preprocessor
This project is designed as a submodule for use in ICMC assembly projects such as [Tusca Simulator](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/Tusca_Simulator). The project contains an easier method to add variables (strings and arrays), and some C-like preprocessor directives, such as #define.

The documentation of the whole project is available [here](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/ICMC-assembly-preprocessor/wiki)
