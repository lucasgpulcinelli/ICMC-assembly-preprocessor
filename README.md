# ICMC Assembly Preprocessor

## General Description
This project is designed as a submodule for use in ICMC assembly projects such as [Tusca Simulator](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/Tusca_Simulator). The project contains an easier method to add variables (strings and arrays), and some C-like preprocessor directives, such as #define.

The documentation about how to use all utilities is available [here](https://github.com/lucasgpulcinelli/ICMC-assembly-preprocessor/wiki).

## Project Template

If you want to start a new project using this preprocessor, you should check out our [repository template](https://github.com/cirillom/icmc-assembly-template-repo). This template can greatly aid your work because it already set's up the preprocessor for immdiate use.
